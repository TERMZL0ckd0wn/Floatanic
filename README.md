# Floatanic Panel

**Floatanic Panel** is a fork of the open-source Skyport control panel built by the [Skyport Team](https://github.com/skyport-team) for managing game servers and apps using Node.js, Express, and Docker.

It aims to be a simple and efficient solution for hosting and managing instances with a clean web interface and container-based deployment.

This fork also aims for selfhosting. I've removed some features from the original panel that is not needed on a selfhosted environment.

## Configuration

Rename `example_config.json` to `config.json` and edit file in the root directory to set up the application settings including the database connection and port.

## Usage

Navigate to `http://localhost:<port>` to access the Floatanic Panel. Log in with your user credentials to manage and view instances.
